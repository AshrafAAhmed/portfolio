                    <img src="/images/img-3.1.png" alt="what is SEO?" width="100%" height="auto">
                    <p class="art-paragraph">SEO stands for <q> Search Engine Optimization</q> and it is all about
                        optimizing
                        websites for search engines like Google, Microsoft Bing, and other search engines whenever
                        people search for things of interest.
                    <p class="art-paragraph">Searchers insert a search query which is a phrase or
                        a keyword combination users enter in search engines to find things of interest. Then, search
                        engines
                        match the keywords in the query with its vast index of web pages, which has been built through
                        continuous crawling and indexing of the web. </p>
                    <p class="art-paragraph">For Search engines to deliver the best results possible, their algorithm assesses
                        and ranks
                        these pages based on hundreds of factors, including relevance, content quality, and user
                        experience. The more accurate the keywords are, the better results to show up in the search
                        engine
                        results page (SERP). More about that later in this article.</p>

                    <h2 class="subheading">The importance of SEO to digital marketers.</h2>
                    <p class="art-paragraph">As a digital marketer, understanding SEO is crucial to obtain success in
                        the digital world. Being able to improve a website's rankings on search engines like Google
                        should boost your digital career. Obviously, as an SEO specialist, you have to implement
                        successful SEO strategies that lead to these factors:</p>

                    <ul class="bullet-list">
                        <li class="bulleted">Increased organic traffic:</li>
                        <p class="art-paragraph">Organic traffic is when searchers visit your website through an organic
                            search. <br><br>Compared to paid advertising, increasing traffic with organic search is a
                            long-term
                            goal that requires time and effort. <br><br>As I have said, it requires time to gain
                            traffic
                            organically and you need to persuade your clients to give it to you.</p>
                        <li class="bulleted">Smooth User Experience:</li>
                        <p class="art-paragraph">People remember things positively or negatively, so when visitors have
                            a good experience on your website, it must be positively remembered.<br><br> To achieve
                            that, improve website design with a familiar navigation section with micro-interaction
                            animation and well-structured text.<br><br> To verify that your website has a comfortable user
                            experience, analyze metrics of engagement like engagement time.</p>
                        <li class="bulleted">Competitive Advantage:</li>
                        <p class="art-paragraph">The competitive advantage of SEO lies in its ability to increase
                            organic traffic to your website.<br><br> By optimizing your site with relevant keywords and
                            quality content, you improve visibility on search engines, making it easier for potential
                            customers to find you. <br><br>For example, businesses that invest in SEO often see higher
                            conversion rates and better ROI compared to other marketing strategies. <br><br>Implementing
                            these SEO tips can help your business stay ahead in a crowded market.</p>
                        <li class="bulleted">Credibility and Trust:</li>
                        <p class="art-paragraph">Credibility and trust are crucial in SEO because they determine how
                            search engines and users perceive a website's reliability and authority.<br><br>
                            High-quality content, reputable backlinks, and user engagement help establish credibility.
                            For example, creating helpful guides and resources can demonstrate expertise and build trust
                            with your audience.<br><br> Trying these SEO practices ensures better search rankings and
                            visitor loyalty, making your SEO efforts more effective and rewarding.</p>
                        <li class="bulleted">Cost-effectiveness:</li>
                        <p class="art-paragraph">Successful SEO strategies enhance cost-effectiveness by reducing
                            advertising expenses and increasing organic traffic. <br><br> By optimizing content with
                            relevant keywords and improving site structure, businesses attract targeted visitors without
                            ads that cost a lot. <br><br> This method provides a sustainable way to reach potential
                            customers and increase revenue.</p>
                        <li class="bulleted">Long-term results and sustainability</li>
                        <p class="art-paragraph">Effective SEO strategies ensure long-term results and sustainability by
                            continuously attracting organic traffic. <br><br> Creating valuable content and following
                            link-building practices helps maintain high rankings for long periods. <br><br> Lastly This
                            approach increases visibility and customer engagement, ensuring lasting benefits for
                            businesses.</p>

                    <p class="art-paragraph">Technical SEO involves optimizing a website's technical elements to improve
                        its search engine rankings. <br><br> This includes improving site speed, ensuring
                        mobile-friendliness, creating an XML sitemap, and fixing broken links. For example, a
                        fast-loading site enhances user experience and reduces bounce rates, which can positively affect
                        rankings. <br><br> Implementing strong technical SEO practices can help search engines crawl and
                        index your site more efficiently, leading to better visibility. Here’s how to do technical SEO
                    </p>
                    <ul class="bullet-list">
                        <li class="bulleted">Mobile-friendliness</li>
                        <p class="art-paragraph">Mobile friendliness is the measure of how well a website is designed
                            and optimized to load on a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet. You need to ensure
                            that load fast with no design issues on various small screens. Finally, the content on the
                            website version and the mobile version must match all the time.</p>
                        <li class="bulleted">Site Speed</li>
                        <p class="art-paragraph">All websites should have good site speed or they are going to perform
                            badly. If a website has a bad site speed, visitors will leave, the bounce rate will be high and
                            all your SEO efforts will not gain any results. Site speed should be 0:0.2 ms, 0.2:1 second
                            is acceptable, and any number higher than 1 second needs immediate improvement.</p>
                        <li class="bulleted">HTTPS</li>
                        <p class="art-paragraph">In the digital world, you need to comfort your visitors that their data
                            are secure. To demonstrate that, you need to enable your website to HTTPS which is more
                            secure than HTTP. An SSL certificate is a data file hosted in a website's origin server. SSL
                            certificates make SSL/TLS encryption possible, and they contain the website's public key and
                            the website's identity, along with related information. </p>
                        <li class="bulleted">Broken Links</li>
                        <p class="art-paragraph">broken links are hyperlinks that point to a page or resource that does
                            not exist. Most often, these linked pages were deleted or moved without a redirection set
                            up. When the user or crawler follows a broken link, the server returns a 404 (Not found) or
                            410 (Gone) status code. You need to fix broken links whether they are broken outgoing links
                            which are links from your website to other domains, or they are broken backlinks which are
                            links <strong>TO</strong> your website from other domains.</p>
                        <li class="bulleted">Crawlability</li>
                        <p class="art-paragraph">Do you like holes in the roads? neither do crawlers. Crawlers are a
                            type of bots that is typically operated by search engines like Google and Bing. They also do
                            not like holes in websites' code to ultra-quickly index the content of websites all across
                            the Internet so that those websites can appear in search engine results.</p>
                    </ul>
